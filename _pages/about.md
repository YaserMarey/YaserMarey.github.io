Assalamo-alykom, this is Yaser. I'm documenting my learning notes in this blog and I am living in Cairo, Egypt. I write not because I know all the answers, I don't! I write to frame the knowledge. In Arabic we say "العلم صيد و الكتابة قيد" which translates to "knowledge is prey caught only with writing" 

Other than reading and writing, I’m leading a software development team and raising three teenagers!

If you have any suggestions or just want to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find something of value in my writing.

Yaser Marey
